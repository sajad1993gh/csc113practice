# Eval(input()) however it crashes when it's given a string input! So always use 2 inputs to convert to r_int
# \ continues the code to the next line!
a = 10
b=6
a/b
# donot import with .py
# dir(p1) p1.a p1.b
# to convert from string to int, only numeric string works. A = int(input("1"))
# print(("Hello", end= "\n") or ..., sep = "")
# print("Hello") is a statement because it doensnt return anything. and we can't assign it to let's say variable a
# True and False are case sensetive
# Tuple can't be changed
