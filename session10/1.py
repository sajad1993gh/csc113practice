# class
# list (arrays)
# list("Hello")
# slicing (mylist[startpoint : endpoint])
# membership ( ... in ... operator returning true or false)
# len
# [1,2,3] + [4] = [1,2,3,4]
# 1 in [1,2,3] --> True
# [1,2,3] < [1,2] --> False . cuz anything is greater than NULL element
# indexing is 0 ..... 3
# 4 .... -1
# pay attention to return data type pf myList[:3] which is slicing which is a list
# access a list inside a list list[][]
# len([1, [1,2], 3]) --> 3
